   Thanks, I am well. I am a 57 year old
   IT consultant, working as a freelancer since 14 years.
   I came through quite OK during all that time, but now
   it is getting harder and harder. I have multiple sclerosis (moderate symptoms)
   and I am not motivated during work. Currently I should be looking for a new contract,
   but I am not motivated to that as well. Sometimes I feel quite down,  but sometimes
   ijt is OK.
   
   What are your recommendations?`,

This free CV critique is intended to give you an honest,
straightforward assessment and some suggestions to help in your job
search. I'm able to offer insight into how you compare to other job
seekers competing for the same positions because I personally review
hundreds of CVs each month.

## Visual Presentation and Organisation ##

The look and feel of your document do not convey "experience" as much
as your actual accomplishments do. Your CV is the first impression a
potential employer has of you. Treat it like your personal marketing
tool.

Using bullets to highlight important details is helpful, but in your
specific case, you should consider using a few less. It can be hard to
narrow in on the most pertinent details when there are too many
bullets. Size and type of bullets are also a consideration. Although
seemingly minor, visual impact of a CV is the key to ensuring that an
employer reads it thoroughly.

## CV Writing ##

Your career summary is not as strong as it should be. This is a key
component to compel the hiring manager to keep reading. Improve your
career summary to define you as a professional and cover those areas
most relevant to your career level and job target.

Based on how the CV is phrased, you could be perceived as a "doer," as
opposed to an "achiever." A few too many of your job descriptions are
task-based rather than results-based. This means that they tell you
what you did, instead of what you achieved. This is a common misstep
for non-professional CV writers. To be effective and create excitement
a good CV aids the hiring executive envisage you delivering similar
achievements at his or her company. Here are some examples of
task-based sentences in your CV:

“Analysis and documentation: ERP systems, SAP implementation”
“CI/CD with Openshift, ArgoCD”

Employers want to learn about your previous achievements and
specifically how you've helped make an impact. More importantly, they
want to know how you are going to make a significant difference at
their organisation.  In reading your CV, I did not find the kind of
active language that would bring your work to life. Instead, I saw
passive words and non-action verbs.

Phrases like “Coordination of” and “Managing” are monotonous,
overused, and add little value to your CV. Strong action verbs, used
with engaging language to outline outstanding achievements, are
essential parts of a soundly-built CV.

Now, let's see how to put this into practice. Here's a real life
sample taken from a former client's CV. By changing the language, we
helped to enhance the perception of the job-seeker.

Passive language / Doing: “Negotiated contracts with vendors”

Action language / Achieving: “Slashed payroll/benefits administration
costs 30% by negotiating pricing and fees, while ensuring the
continuation and enhancements of services.”

An adjustment like this makes a big improvement.

A regular review of every word and sentence in your CV is an important
thing to do, especially if you're the only one looking at it. Hiring
managers are looking for an excuse to eliminate you as a
candidate. You may not be able to see awkward phrases and grammatical
errors if you've already spent too much time with your own CV.  Your
Employment and Education History We recommend limiting your work
history to the past 10 to 15 years as most employers are concerned
with your most current, relevant work experience. Not sure where to
draw the line? Our writers can help you decide what to cut and what to
include in order to craft a solid CV that accurately speaks to your
experience and potential as a candidate.

Consider removing dates from your education section. For someone as
advanced in their career as you, your experience is what employers
find most useful when forming an opinion of you as a candidate, and
should be the focal point of your CV. Removing education dates can
help you steer clear of unconscious bias and ageism without detracting
from your accomplishments.

Alexander, for a professional with 21 years of experience, your CV
undersells you. This is the most important tool in your job search and
it needs to clearly communicate your expertise, unique experience,
accomplishments, and career goals.

HERE ARE THE MAJOR ISSUES HOLDING YOUR CV BACK:

- Cut down your use of bullets. If you include too many, they quickly
  lose effectiveness because nothing stands out.

- Show the outcomes of your efforts. Your CV focuses too much on what
  you’ve done, not what you’ve achieved.

- Your CV does not make a strong visual impression. Your CV should
  appear clean, uncluttered, and appealing to the eye.

- TopCV writers are experts at fixing these kinds of
  problems. Consider working with a professional writer to get a CV
  that sets you up for success.
