   Thanks, I am well. I am a 57 year old
   IT consultant, working as a freelancer since 14 years.
   I came through quite OK during all that time, but now
   it is getting harder and harder. I have multiple sclerosis (moderate symptoms)
   and I am not motivated during work. Currently I should be looking for a new contract,
   but I am not motivated to that as well. Sometimes I feel quite down,  but sometimes
   ijt is OK.
   
   What are your recommendations?
